# java-finding-index-and-decompressing-string

This repository includes 2 questions that I try to implement with Java language.
Note: 
1) All program will interact with a user via console
2) Use JDK 1.8 to execute program

1. To find and get index(es) by searching for an integer within an array of integers.

2. To decompress String. For example, we input `2[abc]3[ab]c` and a result will be `abcabcababc`
